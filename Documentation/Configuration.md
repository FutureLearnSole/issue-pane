# Issue Tracker configuration

The Solid issue tracker system, `issue-pane`, is a very flexible system which can
be configured for many different needs.  Therefore, understanding the
meaning  of the configuration file

Each tracker:

AllowSubIssues Boolean
WF:isssueCategory â€” can be more than one
Superclass of category tree

Wf assigneeGroup
  Maybe several
  Each has vCard members

Also if is doap bug-database of something which has doAp developer x

Wf extrasEntryForm
For any more data to capture for each issue

Also a propertyList an rdf list of properties


Hmmm
Tracker can have issueURITemplate
Might not be used

Tracker has messageStore for where chat goes
Else it goes in stateStore

Where the state all goes at the moment

The main states which issues can have are given by the tracker issueClass
That is crucial
Note some states are subclasses of Open .. by default only open issues are displayed in the list





Each issue

Type Issue
Title
Background color from class of category
